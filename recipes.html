        <h1>Some easy and Some healthy recipes for you.</h1>
        <p class="cursive">
            Because I know you do not know how to cook, though you disagree with it. P.S omelette , tea, coffee (tbh i don't know if you know how to make good tea and coffee but you can some coffee and tea so I am gonna give credit to you for coffee and tea) is not considered as cooking.
            So I am giving you some simple recipes that I would like you to make...for me. I know you do not like sweets, but I love them so I am giving you recipes for deserts too.
            Emphasis on some in some healthy.
        </p>
        <div class="recipe">
            <ol>
                <li class = "recipe">
                    <b>French toast: </b> Take a bowl. Beat an egg into it. Add half cup of milk to the bowl. Add 4 table spoons of sugar to the bowl. 
                    Add a teaspoon of vanilla essence to the bowl. Keep this mixture aside. Let's call this mixture as 'mixture-A'. Light toast bread with butter (Indian homemade butter preferably).
                    cut the toasted bread into the mixture-A. and now again toast this bread with a little butter. Toast it for a minimum of 2 min each side so it will be cooked properly in the middle.
                    You don't have to eat it with honey since it will be sweet enough for both of us. 
                </li>
    
                <li class = "recipe">
                    <b>Pancakes: </b> Take a bowl, Add a cup of maida(since you hate maida I have a wheat flour version too next you can make this for me and the next one for yourself) to it. Add half tablespoon of baking powder(optional but if u add it it will give you a cake like feeling). Now add the mixture-A from above recipe to this bowl.
                    mix them together and make attulu with this batter on a pan and you will pancakes.. again you dont have to add honey to it since the pancakes will already be sweet enough if they are not then maybe add. 
    
                </li>
    
                <li class = "recipe">
                    <b>Wheat version of pancakes: </b> In the pancakes instead of maida use wheat flour and iinstead of sugar use jaggery. 
                    If you don't want to use jaggery too then take few dates take the seeds from them keep the dates in a mixy jar and grind tthem and mix this paste with the batter. P.S wheat and sugar do not taste good.
                </li>
    
                <li class = "recipe">
                    <b>Dry fruit laddoo: </b> You might remember this from when I bought you some, and you might even like to eat this sweet because it does not contain any refined sugar at all.
                    Take whatever nuuts u want and some dates, remove the seeds from the dates. Take 1 date for every 5 nuts. keep all of these nuts and dates in a mixy jar and grind them. You will get a batter from them, make laddoo with it or if u feel lazy grab a spoon and eat the batter, it tastes good... trust me..
                </li>
    
                <li class = "recipe">
                    <b>Sweet Potato Fries: </b> Take some sweet potatos, peel them and cut them into a little thick strips (make sure to make the strips a little thick and not too thin).
                    Soak these sweet potato strips in cold water for 15-30 min. Now boil these strips for not more than 5 minutes in low flame. These sweet potatoes needn't be fully boiled.
                    add a little bit oil, salt to the boiled sweet potato strips. leave it for 10-30min. And now fry it in oil. 
                </li>
    
                <li class = "recipe">
                    <b>Banana Pancakes: </b>This is the easiest recipe so far. Mash a banana add an egg to it and make attulu with it. and u have banana pancakes. 
                    Add maida if u want more cakey structure rather than a omelette like structure. But I figured u would like the omeletty structure better.
