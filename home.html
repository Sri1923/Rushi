        <h1>Hi!!! Happy Birthday my sweety, cutie patootie, squishy, hottie...</h1>

        <p class="cursi">
            I love you Rushi. This is your first birthday after we have been together. I really want to be with you today. 
            But I can't so I want you to feel my presence as much as possible with this. I want to give you everything u want, and spoil my cutie pie a lot.
            But I am broke. But one day I will earn enough money to buy you all the cars you want both toy and real.
            I want to overwhelm you with my kisses and hugs, but I cant come to you right now so sending u a lot of virtual kisses and hugs
            and since i didnt give u normal kisses i am giving you coupons of kisses to reedeem whenever you want to. I also remebered one thing while making this. 
            I never had any favourite color, until u once said I look good in pink, and from then on pinnk has never been the same for me, now,
            I am obsessed with pink and am making everything possible pink including this website. There is a white color box in the bottom, do not forget to click on each word in the white box.
