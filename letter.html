        <h1>A Letter For You</h1>
        <p class="box">
            First things first, Happy birthday. I hope you have a great birthday, and many many more birthdays like this, but all of the  coming ones with me. Have a great birthday,
            not completely for you but from a very selfish point of view of mine. Trust me.. if you have a great birthday my day will be much more greater.. and it is more of a celebration for me than you because
            I am the one who was able to get a great and amazing and perfect boyfriend on this day because his parents had sex 10 months back.
            My pretty baby is turning 22. I Love you a lot. I say this a lot right? But to be honest I don't know if I love you or not. Got a little hurt?
            Wait a minute.. don't get hurt just yet.. I don't know if I love you or not because what is love? Thats an eternal question right?
            I wait all day long to tell you about my day. I wait all night long to see your face in the morning so I often get a little hurt when you tell me you are not coming to mess in the morning.
            But then again that hurt won't last long because I know you would be sleeping or in class. It feels weird to think of you. Because it's like even when I am not thinking about you,
            I think about you, confusing and doesnt make sense right? Let me give you an example like let's say I am learning how to drive I do have my entire concentration on road  and on steering.
            But at the same time I think about how it would be if you were beside me, teaching me how to drive instead of that instructor and I can't help but think
            that learning how to control steering would be more fun if I sit on your lap and learn it while you control the accelerator and the break and the clutch.
            This is just an example, I think things like this literally all day and smmile randomly. When I am too stressed or nervous or too mad at you, sometimes 
            I just imagine your smmiling face like in the picture you took when you went to that trip and suddenly everything seems bareable, thats exactly why whenever I tell you I am not gonna talk to you and go, I come back in 10 minutes.
            It also works the same for that drunk video you sent me.."Nenu padipothunnnnaaanuuu". To think of this is exactly why I ask you to leave me alone. But when you don't leave me alone you just get a 100 times more cuter and 100 times more annoying, but I do like it when you do it.
            I miss you no matter what I do. But knowing that you being happy somewhere makes me more happy. You being sad makes me sadder and when I am not with you when you are sad it feels like the most iportant task to somehow come to you.
            Me not being able to come to you frustrates me. When I am sad, happy, surprised or literally feel any emotion I want to be with you and tell you about it immediately.
            I want to whine about every single minor inconvince to you. If I wanted to start something I immediately want to tell you about it. maybe this is love... I don't know if it is or not.. but if it is then I am too deeply in love with you. So I love you.
            Lots of kisses... ummmahhhhhhh....
