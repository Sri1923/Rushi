            <h2>Read When Angry</h2>
            <p>
                It's okay to feel angry. Take a moment to breathe and let your thoughts settle.
                Think about what made you angry and why. When you're ready, let's talk about it.
                I'm here to listen and help you through it. Anger can be a powerful emotion,
                but together we can turn it into something positive. Remember who you are angry on and tbh I know I get upset when u r angry and show a little bit of 
                it on me, but that's just momentary but after that I get very happy and can't help but smile to myself knowing that you are such a cute kid showing his anger on me.
                I am glad that I am the person who you show every emotion on. Remember, you're not alone.

                Whenever you need to talk, I'm just a call away. We'll navigate this confusion together and find clarity.
